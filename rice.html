    <h2> How to Cook Rice on the Stove</h2>
    <p>When you think about making rice, this is the technique that probably comes to mind first â€” and it starts with a 2:1 ratio of water to rice. This method works well with long-grain white rice. If you've got a short-grain rice, you can always check the package instructions for how to tailor this technique.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Rinse the rice</strong> </li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil, then add the rice. Fill the pot with water (no need to measure), just like you do with pasta water. Bring it to a boil, season with salt, and then carefully add your desired amount of rice.</li>
        <li>Maintain a boil. Boil uncovered without stirring until the rice is softened through but still a tad al dente (read: not mushy).</li>
        <li>Drain the rice. Drain the rice through a fine mesh strainer.</li>
    </ol>
