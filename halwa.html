    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup Sooji (semolina/rava)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Ghee (clarified butter) (or 1/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1¼ cups Water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Sugar</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Pour 1¼ cups water in a small saucepan and bring it to boil over medium flame, it will take around 3-4 minutes. Remove it from the flame and keep aside until you reach step-4 below.</li>
        <li> Take sooji in a heavy based pan, add ghee and heat it over medium flame.</li>
        <li> Stir and mix using spatula.</li>
        <li> Roast it until golden-brown. It will take anywhere between 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li> Reduce flame to low; slowly add boiled water and mix by stirring constantly (add water only in small incremental quantities because it will splutter as soon as you add it).</li>
        <li> Stir and cook to avoid any lump formation.</li>
        <li> Increase flame to medium and cook until all water gets absorbed. Add sugar and cardamom powder and dry fruits.</li>
        <li> The suji halwa is now ready for serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Tips </h3>
    <p>Replace water with milk to enhance its taste and make it softer. The recipe remains exactly the same.</p>
    <p>Dissolve 4-5 saffron strands in 2 tablespoons milk for 5 minutes and add it in the mixture in step-5 to make traditional kesar and badam sooji ka halwa.</p>
